## Slogan: “Fake news is not our friend”

## Motivation
One year ago our former president trump was suggesting misinformation at the white house saying that injecting bleach will cure corona. As a result, there was a 64-year-old businessman selling bleach as a coronavirus cure. Unfortunately, events like this happen because of the spread of misinformation. In general, this kind of fake news is spread by social media and articles. Currently, it’s happening more often than we anticipated. 

Our motivation for this project is the fact that current generations are easily misguided by biased news. One example was during covid when there were thousands of misinformed articles spreading ways to cure covid and where it originated from. To go further into detail, garlic was highly consumed during this time because of this information. 

## Solution
A web platform  platform will help us in identifying what is Real and Fake news.
Before reading an article that could spread misinformation, the reader can check if the article is reliable. They enter the news title they are interested in reading, and our model will detect if the article is real or fake and print the result as an output.
